caption: Flow is a small, palm-sized device designed to monitor air quality on the go. The upper portion of Flow has many small holes located all around the device to allow air to pass into the sensors beneath.Flow collects and stores air quality data throughout the day.To measure the Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and volatile organic comound (VOC) particles, the air is passed over a heated membrane which allows those particles to pass. The energy required to keep the membrane at 350 degrees Celsius is then recorded. Plume Labs has developed a neural network to process all the incoming data and to convert it into useful air quality readings. Flow haw also an app. The app's home screen is a timeline of days your Flow has recorded data. The top of the page shows today's data while connected. Scrolling through the list takes you through older entries. Each day is summarized with a location, the average AQI, and a severity rating. Tapping on an entry allows you to see the day in more detail, with average PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and VOC values displayed.
